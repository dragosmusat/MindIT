download oracle 11g xe 

1. rpm -ivh oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm 
2. /etc/init.d/oracle-xe configure - accept defaults - admin password for sys and sysdba 
3. set $ORACLE_HOME,$ORACLE_PATH environment variables, SID is already set to XE by config script above.
4. i will not create 3 databases for each system. Only 1 is enough, with 3 user schemas. In case of creating from scratch CREATE DATABASE statement can be called after deciding the sid, and init parameter file of the db, a sample is in /dbs folder. 
5. run ./$ORACLE_HOME/bin/sqlplus / as sysdba@XE /home/mindIT/create_schemas.sql - to create user schemas and grant privileges - or run the contents in a SQL client - not tested on sqlplus but should work
6. PR_PRICE in the definition provided - has 2 PK, which is invalid. A table can have only one PK first. But according to the requirements the item_id cannot be pk, and neither price_date. Dropped constraints
7. run ./$ORACLE_HOME/bin/sqlplus / as sysdba@XE < /home/mindIT/create_tables.sql - or run the contents in a SQL client - not tested on sqlplus but should work
8. run ./$ORACLE_HOME/bin/sqlplus / as sysdba@XE < /home/mindIT/populate_tables.sql - or run the contents in a SQL client  - not tested on sqlplus but should work
9. I will use an ESB(IIB9) not ETL to populate PA_ITEM table. To ETL informatica i have no access right now.
10. We will asume Integration BUS was already configured. Datasource used is present in odbc.ini file.
11. deploy bar file from release. 
12. exposed ws will be called with a dummy id. it will return success if PA_ITEM had rows inserted.
13. It will work only once since ITEM_ID is a pk in that table. 
14. this is just a dummy test, not the most performant solution but it does the job.
